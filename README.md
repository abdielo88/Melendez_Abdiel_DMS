Database Management System for the Game4Life company.
This version of the code only has the main components of the system which will allow the user achieve their main purposes, including
uploading a file with data to the program, displaying that list, adding items to that list, removing them, and ordering more items; it doesn't
contain the GUI and database components yet.
