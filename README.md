Database Management System for the Game4Life company.
This code will help the (fictitiuos) game company, Game4Life, to manage their inventory by using a program that can:
display the games in that inventory, add more games to that inventory, remove (or sell) games, update any game on
that list, and make orders for more games. The user can either use the code that works with the text files or, optionally,
use the other code to connect to a database and manage the data from there.
